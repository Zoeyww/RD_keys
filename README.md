* Database keys helps us have integrity constraint in our database and since integrity constraint is one of the factors of DBMS we really care about database keys.

There are three different keys that we are focusing on. These keys are:

1. Primary Key
2. Unique Key
3. Foreing Key

#### Primary Key



#### Unique Key

Unique key is the minimal subset of attributes that allows us to uniquely identify a tuple in our table. So, unique key is very similar to primary key. However there are some big differences between them. These differences are:
1. Unique key can actually be null.
2. We are allowed to have more than one primary keys.
Now you might ask yourself "why do we need to have unique keys then?". This is a good question which I will explain using an example. Think we have a table for instructors with attributes:
 * id
 * name
 * last name
 * phone number
 * email


#### Foreign Key
